# Python Projects Collection
<br>

Welcome to my **Python Projects** repository!  
<br>
This repo is a collection of all the Python small projects I’ve worked on while learning, experimenting, and building useful (and fun) programs.  
Each folder contains a project with its own purpose, source code, and sometimes additional notes.
