# Python Projects Collection

Welcome to my **Python Projects** repository!  
This repo is a collection of all the Python small projects I’ve worked on while learning, experimenting, and building useful (and fun) programs.  
Each folder contains a project with its own purpose, source code, and sometimes additional notes.

---

##  Repository Structure
- Each project is stored in its own folder(except small ones).
- Folder names are descriptive of the project.
- Some projects may include:
  - `README.md` (explaining the project)
  - Source code and assets.

---

##  Projects Included
Here are some of the types of projects you’ll find here:

- **Games** – Hangman, Blackjack, Number Guessing, Snake, etc.
- **Automation** – small scripts to automate tasks.
- **Data** – mini projects with data handling, charts, and simple analysis.
- **Practice** – exercises from bootcamps and courses.

*(The list will grow as I continue learning and adding more projects!)*
